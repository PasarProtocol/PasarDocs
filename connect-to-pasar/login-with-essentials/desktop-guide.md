### Step 2: Select the Wallet

From this screen you can choose the Wallet to log in with, you have two options:

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Metamask**</mark>: You can log in with a normal Wallet, without DID, with some limitations though. You will not be able to customize your profile, sell NFTs, create collections.
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Elastos Essentials**</mark>: By logging in with Essentials you will have no limitations, because Essentials supports DIDs.\
  If you don't know what a DID is you can press _**"What is a DID?"**_ in this page.\
  If you don't have a Wallet you can press _**"I Don't Have A Wallet"**_ and download <mark style="color:purple;">**Elastos Essentials**</mark>.
