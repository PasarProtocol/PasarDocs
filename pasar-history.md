# Pasar history

Pasar Decentralised Marketplace (DeMKT) started as part of the Feeds mobile application, and was presented as an attractive feature for users to mint and trade NFTs on ESC. It was the very first NFT collection and marketplace on the Elastos ecosystem.&#x20;

When the NFT features in Feeds became popular, and since it's a standalone feature From Feeds application, a proposal has been made for funding from the Cyber Republic (Elastos DAO) to launch the Pasar web application, therefore Pasar became a separate branding project, and is officially separated from Feeds.&#x20;

## Evolved Stages

According to the [Pasar Proposal](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals/61953f89eb709a00784155ab), Pasar web application has evolved in three stages.

### Pasar Explorer

Pasar explorer is live after the first milestone in Proposal finished. Users can browse and explore any NFTs or transactions on the DeMKT.  The provenances of all NFTs on Feeds collection and transactions on Market can be easily checked and verified.

### Pasar V1 Market

Pasar marketplace v1 is available with the same features as Feeds mobile app after the second milestone in the proposal finished, but users can mint NFTs from only one general collection (Feeds FTSK Sticker) and trade NFTs with the fixed $ELA pricing.&#x20;

### Pasar V2 Market

To make Pasar be a popular marketplace to trade data assets, there is a list of significant features now integrated in Pasar v2, like:

* Dedicated collection support
* ERC20 tokens as pricing tokens
* Batch minting and selling support
* Auction with a reserve price and buyback price support
* $DIA holders featured use cases
* Profile data stored and shared from Hive/Vault
* KYC-ed credentials integrated as a badge to present a better reputation

## Conclusion

Now, Pasar web application is already a fully standalone project, and is on the way to be community-driven project. Pasar team is currently working on PASAR tokenomics, and then users can earn rewards from trading NFTs on Pasar DeMKT.&#x20;
