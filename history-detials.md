# History Details

Pasar has been started from Feeds mobile application and was presented as an attractive feature to users to mint and trade NFTs on ESC, which is the very first NFT collection and marketplace on the Elastos ecosystem.&#x20;

When the NFT features in Feeds became popular, and since it's a standalone feature From Feeds social network, a proposal has been made to apply for funding from CRC to launch Pasar web application, therefore Pasar become the side project, and is officially separated from Feeds.&#x20;

According to the [Pasar proposal](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals/61953f89eb709a00784155ab), Pasar webApp has evolved in three stages.  Firstly,  Pasar explorer has been living and users can browse and explore any NFTs or transactions. Next, Pasar marketplace v1 is on stage with the same feature as Feeds mobile app, where users can mint NFTs from only one general collection (Feeds FTSK Sticker) and trade NFTs with the fixed $ELA price on the market.&#x20;

To make Pasar be a popular marketplace to trade data assets, there is a list of significant features integrated like:\
\- Dedicated collection support\
\- ERC20 tokens as pricing tokens\
\- Batch minting and selling supported\
\- Auction with a reserve price and buyback price supported\
\- DIA holding featured use cases\
\- Profile data would be stored and shared from Hive/Vault\
\- KYC-ed credentials integrated as a badge to present a better reputation

Now, Pasar webApp become a fully standalone project, and hope it can be a community-driven project. Next Pasar team is working on tokenomics feature. With tokenomics, users would get rewards while they are trading NFTs on PasarV2 marketplace.&#x20;
