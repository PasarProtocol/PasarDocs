# History Details

Pasar Decentralised Marketplace (DeMKT) started as part of the Feeds mobile application, and was presented as an attractive feature for users to mint and trade NFTs on ESC. It was the very first NFT collection and marketplace on the Elastos ecosystem.&#x20;

When the NFT features in Feeds became popular, and since it's a standalone feature From Feeds social network, a proposal has been made for funding from the Cyber Republic (Elastos DAO) to launch the Pasar web application, therefore Pasar became a separate project, and is officially separated from Feeds.&#x20;

According to the [Pasar Proposal](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals/61953f89eb709a00784155ab), Pasar webApp has evolved in three stages. &#x20;

Firstly, Pasar explorer is live, and users can browse and explore any NFTs or transactions on the DeMKT.&#x20;

Secondly, Pasar marketplace v1 is available with the same features as Feeds mobile app, where users can mint NFTs from only one general collection (Feeds FTSK Sticker) and trade NFTs with the fixed $ELA pricing.&#x20;

Finally, to make Pasar be a popular marketplace to trade data assets, there is a list of significant features now integrated in Pasar v2, like:\
\- Dedicated collection support\
\- ERC20 tokens as pricing tokens\
\- Batch minting and selling support\
\- Auction with a reserve price and buyback price support\
\- $DIA holders featured use cases\
\- Profile data stored and shared from Hive/Vault\
\- KYC-ed credentials integrated as a badge to present a better reputation

Currently, Pasar webApp is a fully standalone project, and can be a community-driven project.

Next steps: The Pasar team is working on $PASAR tokenomic design. With a platform token, users can earn rewards while they are trading NFTs on Pasar v2 DeMKT.&#x20;
