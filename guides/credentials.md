Write the content you want to share, in this case _**paste the link**_ of your twitter profile.

{% hint style="info" %}
Attention, these are self-issued credentials, the value that can be attributed to them is relative, it all depends on the dApp that accepts them. \
To have greater reliability, you should have <mark style="color:green;">verifiable</mark> credentials (VCs) that are issued by some dApps, which are responsible for verifying a certain type of information. \
An example of VCs are those issued by [**kyc-me**](https://kyc-me.io/), with which it is possible to obtain the Kyc-me Badge on Pasar. \
You can learn more about this topic on the specific section of the documentation: [verifiable-credentials](../reputation-system/verifiable-credentials/ "mention")
