# Collections

## Public Collections

There are already two public collections for any users to mint NFTs:

* Feeds FSTK Sticker collection (FSTK)
* Pasar collection (PSRC)

The FSTK collection is the first public collection on Feeds and now it has been integrated into Pasar platform. Original users from Feeds still can use it to mint NFTs and sell NFTs onto PasarV2 market.&#x20;

Pasar collection is another public collection for PasarV2 platform, and it's the recommend onefor users to mint NFTs on Pasar.

## Private Collections

Private collections are the collections created by users (usually artists) or imported by owners outside Pasar.  All NFTs in the private collections would be minted or deployed by collection owners.

To the collections created by users on Pasar, only the collection owner has the permission to mint NFTs from this collection, and collection owner can list it onto Pasar for the primary sale. Other users can not mint NFTs from the private collection without ownership.

To the collections imported by users outside Pasar, usually users (or the collection owners) minted NFTs outside Pasar (usually on it's webpage), and they can list NFTs on this collection onto Pasar on Pasar marketplace.
