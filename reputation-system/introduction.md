# Introduction

Pasar reputation system is the side project to Pasar platform, and it will take long time to get evolved.  The computation of reputation for specific user with DID mainly would be carried on the assist services, the backend services to cached the on-chain data as well as off-chain but immutable data from IPFS gateway, and to speed up the process to provide data service to frontend web application.

Pasar reputation system would be evolved with the following different parts:

* Badges, currently we have DIA holding badge and KYC-ed credenital badge. And there will be more and more kinds of badges would be integrated when the project moves forward;
* Decentralized voting system (Being planed). Users can report (down vote) scam NFTs or creators with solid proofs, also would upvote the NFTs if you really like the NFTs and creators. But all votes would be managed on the contracts, which would prevent from faking vote.&#x20;
* Trading and created NFTs&#x20;
